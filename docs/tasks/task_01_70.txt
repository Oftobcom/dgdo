Of course! This is an excellent way to engage students in a real-world project. Here are 70 simple, contribution-focused tasks for your students, categorized as requested. The tasks are designed to be mostly independent, allowing students to work in parallel and see their code integrated into the larger system.

---

### 1. FastAPI Gateway (Python - FastAPI)

**Focus:** Building the core REST API endpoints for the system.

1.  **Create Passenger Endpoint:** Implement a POST `/passengers` endpoint to register a new passenger (accept `name`, `email`, `phone`).
2.  **Get Passenger Endpoint:** Implement a GET `/passengers/{passenger_id}` endpoint to retrieve a passenger's details.
3.  **Create Driver Endpoint:** Implement a POST `/drivers` endpoint to register a new driver (accept `name`, `email`, `phone`, `car_details`).
4.  **Update Driver Status:** Implement a PATCH `/drivers/{driver_id}/status` endpoint to allow a driver to update their status (e.g., `"available"`, `"unavailable"`).
5.  **Create Trip Request:** Implement a POST `/trips` endpoint for a passenger to request a trip (accept `passenger_id`, `pickup_lat`, `pickup_lon`, `dropoff_lat`, `dropoff_lon`).
6.  **Get Trip Details:** Implement a GET `/trips/{trip_id}` endpoint to fetch the status and details of a specific trip.
7.  **Driver Accepts Trip:** Implement a POST `/trips/{trip_id}/accept` endpoint for a driver to accept a trip request.
8.  **Update Trip Status:** Implement a PATCH `/trips/{trip_id}/status` endpoint to update the trip's status (e.g., `"accepted"` -> `"en_route"` -> `"completed"`).
9.  **List All Drivers:** Implement a GET `/drivers` endpoint (for the admin panel) to list all drivers.
10. **Health Check Endpoint:** Implement a simple GET `/health` endpoint that returns `{"status": "ok"}`.

### 2. Python WebSocket

**Focus:** Handling real-time communication for location updates and notifications.

11. **WebSocket Connection Manager:** Create a basic `ConnectionManager` class to manage active WebSocket connections (e.g., `connect`, `disconnect`, `send_personal_message`).
12. **Driver Location Broadcast:** Implement a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/drivers/{driver_id}`) that accepts a driver's current latitude/longitude and broadcasts it to all connected admin panel clients.
13. **Passenger Trip Updates:** Implement a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/passengers/{passenger_id}`) that sends trip status updates (e.g., "Driver assigned", "Driver arriving") to the specific passenger.
14. **Driver Assignment Notification:** Create a function that, when a driver is assigned to a trip, sends a real-time notification via WebSocket to that specific driver.
15. **Broadcast to All Admins:** Add a method to the `ConnectionManager` to broadcast a message (e.g., "New trip requested") to all connected admin panel clients.
16. **Handle WebSocket Disconnects:** Improve the `disconnect` method to log when a driver or admin panel disconnects.
17. **Ping-Pong Heartbeat:** Implement a simple heartbeat (ping-pong) in the WebSocket handler to keep connections alive and detect dead ones.
18. **Send Driver List on Connect:** When an admin panel connects, automatically send the current list of all available drivers.
19. **Trip Completion Notification:** Create a function that sends a WebSocket message to the passenger when the driver marks the trip as "completed".
20. **Authentication Stub for WebSocket:** Create a placeholder function for WebSocket authentication (it can just check for a token in the query string, without full validation for now).

### 3. C++ Matching Engine

**Focus:** Defining core data structures and the initial matching logic.

21. **Define `Location` Struct:** Create a `struct Location` with `latitude` and `longitude` (double) members.
22. **Define `Driver` Struct:** Create a `struct Driver` with `id` (int), `location` (Location), and `is_available` (bool).
23. **Define `TripRequest` Struct:** Create a `struct TripRequest` with `id` (int), `passenger_location` (Location), and `dropoff_location` (Location).
24. **Calculate Distance Function:** Write a function `calculate_distance(Location loc1, Location loc2)` that returns the Euclidean distance (good enough for MVP).
25. **Find Nearest Driver (Naive):** Implement a function `find_nearest_driver(TripRequest request, std::vector<Driver> drivers)` that loops through all available drivers and returns the ID of the closest one.
26. **Add Driver to Pool:** Create a function `add_driver(Driver new_driver)` that adds a driver to an in-memory `std::vector` (the "driver pool").
27. **Remove Driver from Pool:** Create a function `remove_driver(int driver_id)` that removes a driver from the pool (e.g., when they go offline).
28. **Update Driver Location:** Create a function `update_driver_location(int driver_id, Location new_location)`.
29. **Simple Matching Loop:** Create a function `void run_matching_loop()` that, in a loop, checks for new trip requests and assigns the nearest driver (using the function from #25). It can sleep for a short period between iterations.
30. **Create a Trip Assignment Struct:** Define a `struct TripAssignment { int trip_id; int driver_id; }` to be the output of the matching process.

### 4. React.js Admin Panel

**Focus:** Building the UI components for the admin dashboard.

31. **Setup and Component Scaffolding:** Create a new React app and basic components: `Dashboard`, `DriverList`, `TripList`.
32. **Driver List Component:** Create the `DriverList` component to display a simple table of drivers (ID, Name, Status).
33. **Trip List Component:** Create the `TripList` component to display a table of trips (ID, Passenger ID, Status).
34. **Fetch and Display Drivers:** Use the `fetch` API inside `DriverList` to GET `/drivers` from the FastAPI gateway and display the data.
35. **Fetch and Display Trips:** Use the `fetch` API inside `TripList` to GET a new `/trips` endpoint (you may need to create a `GET /trips` endpoint in the gateway) and display the data.
36. **WebSocket Connection in React:** Establish a WebSocket connection from the `Dashboard` component to the gateway's admin broadcast endpoint.
37. **Real-time Driver Status Update:** When a "driver status updated" message is received via WebSocket, update the `DriverList` component in real-time.
38. **Real-time New Trip Alert:** When a "new trip requested" message is received via WebSocket, show a browser alert or a toast notification.
39. **Basic Styling with CSS:** Apply basic CSS to the `DriverList` and `TripList` tables to make them readable (e.g., borders, padding).
40. **Admin Panel Routing Stub:** Set up React Router with placeholder routes for `/drivers` and `/trips`, even if they just render the same components for now.

47. **Setup a Linter for React:** Add `eslint` to the React project with a basic configuration.
48. **Create a Logging Format Standard:** Define a simple JSON logging format for the FastAPI gateway and implement it in one endpoint.
49. **Environment Variables for Configuration:** Move the database connection string in the FastAPI app to be read from an environment variable.
50. **Create a Simple `test_api.sh` Script:** Write a bash script that uses `curl` to test the `/health` and `/passengers` endpoints to verify the API is up.

### 7. PostgreSQL Database

**Focus:** Designing and interacting with the database schema.

61. **Create `passengers` Table:** Write a SQL script to create a `passengers` table with `id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)`, `name (VARCHAR)`, `email (VARCHAR)`, and `created_at (TIMESTAMP)`.
62. **Create `drivers` Table:** Write a SQL script to create a `drivers` table with `id`, `name`, `email`, `status (VARCHAR)`, and `current_location (POINT)` or `lat (DECIMAL)`, `lon (DECIMAL)`.
