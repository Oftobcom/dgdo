Below are **70 simple, student-friendly tasks** that contribute small but meaningful parts toward an **Analytics + ML + Data-Driven** subsystem of your *DG Do* project.

All tasks are **function-level**, **simple**, and **incremental**, so twenty students can work in parallel and still contribute.

3. Write a function to group trips by city zone (grid of squares).
4. Implement a function that counts trips per zone per hour.
5. Add a script that plots (matplotlib) trips/hour (static PNG).
6. Implement a moving-average smoothing for hourly demand.
7. Implement a simple linear regression predicting next hour demand.
8. Add a FastAPI route `/forecast/next-hour`.
9. Create a function that logs prediction results into a new table.
10. Write a function that exports forecast results to CSV.

# 🚕 **B. Driver Churn Prediction (10 tasks)**

Identify drivers likely to leave platform.

11. Create a function that loads driver activity logs.
12. Count days since last completed trip for each driver.
13. Implement a function computing average trips/day per driver.
14. Build a simple churn score = "days inactive × 0.5 − avg trips × 0.3".
15. Add a FastAPI endpoint `/analytics/churn-scores`.
16. Write a task to visualize churn distribution (histogram).
17. Implement a function labeling drivers as "low/medium/high" churn risk.
18. Build a weekly job (simple function) to refresh churn predictions.
19. Add a function storing churn scores in DB.

# 🗺️ **C. Route Optimization ML (10 tasks)**

Learn from historical data to improve ETAs.

21. Load historical trips with actual durations from DB.
22. Compute geographic distance using Haversine formula.
23. Create a baseline ETA model: duration = distance / avg_speed.
24. Add weather factor mock (rain, snow → +10% duration).
25. Add time-of-day factor mock (rush hour → +20% duration).
26. Build a simple linear model combining the factors.
27. Add FastAPI endpoint `/eta/predict`.
28. Create function recording prediction errors.
29. Implement function updating avg_speed by driver.
30. Load error statistics and print MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

# 💸 **D. Dynamic Pricing Models (10 tasks)**

More advanced surge pricing.

31. Create a function computing demand-to-supply ratio by zone.
32. Implement surge coefficient = min(1 + ratio × 0.3, 3.0).
33. Add temporal factor: night hours → −20% surge.
34. Add weather factor: bad weather → +15% surge.
35. Combine factors into final dynamic price multiplier.
36. Build endpoint `/pricing/dynamic`.
37. Create DB table storing surge history per zone.
38. Write function for rolling-average smoothing of surge.
39. Build script to simulate surge for last 24 hours.
40. Create JSON report of surge events (e.g., surge > 2.0).

---

# ⚠️ **E. Anomaly Detection (10 tasks)**

Fraud & system abuse detection.

41. Load trip logs with payments.
42. Implement rule: unusually short trips (<200m) flagged as anomalies.
43. Rule: unusually long trips (>80km) flagged.
44. Rule: too frequent cancellations (>5 per hour).
45. Rule: multiple accounts from same device.
46. Aggregate anomaly flags into an "anomaly score".
47. Store anomaly events in DB table `trip_anomalies`.
48. Endpoint `/analytics/anomalies`.
49. Daily summary function: print total anomalies.
50. Build function that emails (mock) admin list of anomalies.

---

# 🧪 **F. A/B Testing Framework (10 tasks)**

Compare features & algorithms.
