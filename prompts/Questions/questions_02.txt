# 🔹 VERY BEGINNER (10 questions)

*(Checks basic system awareness & vocabulary)*

### 1. What problem does Uber/Lyft/Bolt solve?

**Hint:** Two-sided marketplace, riders ↔ drivers, real-time coordination.

### 2. What are the main users of the system?

**Hint:** Rider app, driver app, operations/admin.

### 3. What happens after a rider presses “Request Ride”?

**Hint:** Request → backend → driver search → assignment.

### 4. Why does the system need a backend at all?

**Hint:** Coordination, security, scalability, shared state.

### 5. What is a microservice?

**Hint:** Small, independent service with a single responsibility.

### 6. What data does a rider send when requesting a trip?

**Hint:** Pickup, dropoff, time, user ID.

### 7. What data does a driver send continuously?

**Hint:** GPS coordinates, availability state.

### 8. Why can’t drivers just message riders directly?

**Hint:** Privacy, trust, system control.

### 9. What is latency?

**Hint:** Time between request and response.

### 10. What is scalability in simple words?

**Hint:** Handle more users without breaking.

# 🔹 BEGINNER (10 questions)

*(Checks understanding of components & simple trade-offs)*

### 11. What are the main backend services in a ride-hailing system?

**Hint:** Auth, matching, pricing, trips, payments.

### 12. How does the system find nearby drivers?

**Hint:** Geo-indexing, grid, distance search.

### 13. Why is real-time communication needed?

**Hint:** Location updates, trip status.

### 14. What is surge pricing?

**Hint:** Demand > supply → price multiplier.

### 15. Why use Redis or in-memory cache?

**Hint:** Fast access to frequently changing data.

### 16. Why separate rider and driver apps?

**Hint:** Different roles, flows, permissions.

### 17. What happens if a driver rejects a ride?

**Hint:** Try next candidate, timeout logic.

### 18. Why should services be stateless?

**Hint:** Easier scaling, failover.

### 19. What kind of database stores trip history?

**Hint:** Relational DB, strong consistency.

### 20. Why do we need logging and monitoring?

**Hint:** Debugging, failures, metrics.

# 🔹 INTERMEDIATE (10 questions)

*(Checks system design thinking & distributed systems knowledge)*

### 21. How would you prevent two drivers from accepting the same ride?

**Hint:** Locking, reservation, compare-and-set.

### 22. How do you scale the matching service to millions of users?

**Hint:** Sharding by region, horizontal scaling.

### 23. GeoHash vs QuadTree vs H3 — why does it matter?

**Hint:** Accuracy, performance, global scale.

### 24. Where is strong consistency required, and where is eventual consistency acceptable?

**Hint:** Money & state vs location updates.

### 25. What happens if the pricing service goes down?

**Hint:** Fallbacks, graceful degradation.

### 26. How do you handle traffic spikes (rain, events, rush hour)?

**Hint:** Auto-scaling, queues, backpressure.

### 27. How would you design the trip state machine?

**Hint:** Immutable transitions, clear states.

### 28. How do you ensure positive unit economics per trip?

**Hint:** Fare > payout + costs, fail fast.

### 29. What events would you publish during a trip lifecycle?

**Hint:** Requested, matched, started, completed.

### 30. Where would ML be useful, and where would rules be better?

**Hint:** Predictions vs hard business constraints.

# 🎯 How interviewers evaluate answers

They listen for:

* **Clear structure**
* **Trade-offs awareness**
* **Failure thinking**
* **Economic and operational realism**

Not for buzzwords.

If you want next:

* **Model answers (short & long)**
* Turn this into a **mock interview**
* Add **advanced / staff-level questions**
* Map these questions directly to **DG DO architecture**

Just say which one.
