I’m sending a long context. Do not reply until I write: READY. Just acknowledge received.

I’m developing the open-source project "DG Do Matching Engine", a ride-hailing platform similar to Uber, Lyft, Bolt, and Yandex Go; take into account the features of Dodo Pizza, Dodo IS.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Launch
Start the full system with:
 docker compose up

Version 0.1 — Must-Have Features:
Passenger registration
Submitting a trip request: from → to
Display available drivers on the map
Driver assignment algorithm
Order status flow: accepted → en route → completed
Simple admin panel
REST + WebSocket API
Dashboards and open APIs are needed to monitor system status.
Build data for ML with drift detection
Risk management. For example, checking limits: one TripRequest per passenger, one Trip per driver


Architecture & Stack
High-load components (matching, routing) in C++ gRPC
API Gateway in Python FastAPI
Admin Panel in React.js
Geographical data handling with PostGIS
Map data from OpenStreetMap (OSM)
Routing engine using Valhalla for real-world routes
WebSocket to push driver locations to the map
Use TileServer GL to serve vector tiles generated from OSM data (Khujand)
Integrate MapLibre in React
API Contracts (protobuf first!)
.proto files are your single source of truth
Trip Finite State Machine is explicit
ClickHouse used only for: telemetry, analytics, ML
Local Prometheus/Grafana dashboard showing the metrics from golden path test
