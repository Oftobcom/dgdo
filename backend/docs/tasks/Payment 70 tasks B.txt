Below are **70 simple, student-friendly tasks**, each producing a tiny but real contribution to the **Payment & Pricing subsystem** of your DG Do MVP.

They are divided exactly as you requested:

* **10 Surge Pricing tasks**
* **10 Multiple Payment Method tasks**
* **10 Split Payment tasks**
* **10 Commission Structure tasks**
* **10 Invoice Generation tasks**
* **10 Fraud Detection tasks**
* **10 Refund Processing tasks**

All tasks are **simple**, **isolated**, and ideal for *20 students working in parallel*.

These tasks will accumulate into a real payment/pricing subsystem for your ride-hailing MVP.

# 🟦 **A. Dynamic Pricing (Surge Pricing) — 10 Tasks**

1. Create a FastAPI function that returns current surge multiplier (default = 1.0).
2. Add database table `surge_zones` with fields `(zone_id, multiplier)`.
3. Implement endpoint to update surge multiplier for a zone.
4. Write function to get surge multiplier by coordinate (point).
5. Add C++ stub that receives multiplier as input.
6. Implement Python function applying surge pricing: `base_price * multiplier`.
7. Create endpoint `/pricing/estimate` that returns estimated price with surge.
8. Add validation: multiplier must be between 1.0 and 5.0.
9. Add cron job (mock) that sets multiplier to 1.0 at night.
10. Create a simple UI widget in React to show “Surge in your area”.

# 🟦 **B. Multiple Payment Methods — 10 Tasks**

1. Add table `payment_methods` for each passenger.
2. Implement FastAPI endpoint: “Add payment method”.
3. Implement FastAPI endpoint: “List user payment methods”.
4. Add attribute “is_default” to payment methods.
5. Write FastAPI endpoint: “Set default payment method”.
6. Write validation: only one default method allowed.
7. Add field `payment_method_id` to trip creation request.
8. Add mock integration class `CreditCardProcessor` (dummy).
9. Add dummy `DigitalWalletProcessor` (returns “OK”).
10. Add route that checks if payment method exists before starting a trip.

---

# 🟦 **C. Split Payments — 10 Tasks**

1. Add `co_passengers` array to trip request model.
2. Implement function that calculates per-person share:
   `total_fare / count_passengers`.
3. Add endpoint allowing passenger to accept split fare.
4. Add endpoint allowing passenger to reject split fare.
5. Create DB table `split_payments` (trip_id, user_id, share_amount).
6. Add backend logic to recalc shares if number of passengers changes.
7. Add API endpoint that shows each passenger’s current share.
8. Validate: total shares must sum to trip fare (simple check).
9. Add React panel showing per-person price breakdown.
10. Add unit test checking split payments with 2, 3, 4 passengers.

---

# 🟦 **D. Commission Structure — 10 Tasks**

1. Add table `commission_rules` containing base percentage (e.g., 20%).
2. Write API endpoint to update commission % (admin only).
3. Implement function:
   `platform_cut = fare * commission_percent / 100`.
4. Add journey completion logic calculating (driver_earnings, platform_cut).
5. Add field “bonus” to driver profile.
6. Implement function: add bonus if driver completes 10 trips/day (mock).
7. Add endpoint `/driver/earnings/today`.
8. Add summary for admin: total platform income today.
9. Add DB migration adding `earnings_history` table.
10. Add React module “Driver Earnings Summary”.

---

# 🟦 **E. Invoice Generation — 10 Tasks**

1. Create `invoices` table storing `(trip_id, passenger_id, amount, pdf_url)`.
2. Write function generating simple text invoice (no PDF).
3. Add endpoint: `/invoice/{trip_id}` returning invoice text.
4. Add driver name & car model to invoice.
5. Add timestamps (trip start, trip end) to invoice.
6. Add surge multiplier info into invoice.
7. Add method to store invoice in DB.
8. Add email sending stub (just print “email sent”).
9. Add admin panel page listing all invoices.
10. Add a unit test verifying invoice totals.

---

# 🟦 **F. Fraud Detection — 10 Tasks**

1. Add table `fraud_flags` storing suspicious events.
2. Add logic: flag if the same passenger uses 5 cards in 10 minutes.
3. Add logic: flag if fare exceeds 10× city average.
4. Add logic: flag if driver position jumps more than 3 km instantly.
5. Create endpoint `/fraud/check-trip/{trip_id}` returning flags.
6. Add React admin page displaying flagged trips.
7. Add function marking a flag as “reviewed”.
8. Build dashboard: total fraud cases per day.
9. Unit test: fake a jump in driver location → expect fraud flag.
10. Add endpoint that disables user account if too many fraud flags.

---

# 🟦 **G. Refund Processing — 10 Tasks**

1. Add DB table `refund_requests` (trip_id, user_id, reason).
2. Implement endpoint: passenger submits refund request.
3. Add endpoint: admin approves refund.
4. Add endpoint: admin rejects refund.
5. Add FastAPI function to compute refund amount (simple rule).
6. Add event: when refund approved, subtract from platform income.
7. Add event: when refund approved, notify driver (stub).
8. Add event: send email to passenger (stub).
9. Create admin React page for refund requests.
10. Add pytest validating refund approval workflow.
